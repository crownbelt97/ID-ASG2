## Background Information
SneakySneakers is a fictional sneaker retailer that sells limited edition sneakers at competitive prices. We aim to provide customers with only 100% authentic sneakers for the community and supports the local sneaker community. 
SneakySneakers is an idea from Ye Xuan's personal carousell sneaker reselling account SneakySnickers and our love and passion for sneakers. This idea is 100% original by Ye Xuan Chua and Jeremy Chan.
